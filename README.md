Isolate is a minimalistic image browser for local files.

Isolate works off of your local file system: you get started by dragging and dropping a folder onto the application window. After that, you can navigate to subfolders, search for filenames and open images in full res. Not having to go over the internet [keeps things much faster than other tools like Pinterest.](https://twitter.com/seenaburns/status/950054230852694016)

##### Great things about Isolate

- **No BS**: Isolate isn't a social tool, there's no sharing, notifications, discovery. It just does its job and stays out of your way.
- **Quick**: 
- **Manage your images how you like**: Isolate just reflects your directory structure, you get to organize things how you see fit (even with nested folders)

### Install

See [releases](https://github.com/seenaburns/Isolate/releases) for prebuilt applications, or `npm install && npm start` after cloning

### Usage

Isolate works off of a base folder, when you first start drag and drop a folder to browse it. You can always drag and drop another folder if you ever want to browse another folder.

Navigating to a folder will give you a mosaic tile view of your images, with subdirectories listed at the top.

A search bar in the top right will search for any files with the term in their path. For example `2d` would match anything in my `inspo/2d/` folder.

Clicking on any image will open it, fitting to the window.

From here, you can

- Zoom with the `z` key or the Z button in the top Right
- Close with the `ESC` key or the X button in the top Right,
- Navigate between images with the `Left` and `Right` arrow keys
